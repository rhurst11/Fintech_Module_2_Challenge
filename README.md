# Module 2 Challenge: Expanding My Loan Qualifier Application

This application allows a user to input CSV data of different loans along with some of their own finanical information, and subsequently view a series of loans that they qualify for. The user may also save the data of their qualifying loans as a CSV file. All of the user-application dialogue occurs within a Command Line Interface, and prompts the user to input information when necessary.
